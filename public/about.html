<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is SÃ¶ren and normally i follow a complete different job in my daily life and only
  started programming in my freetime. First I started with c++ and c# to create games in Unity.
  I created many different small games, from race games to strategie games to shooting games with
  the help of Udemy. My favorite game was a tower defense game in a medival setting.
  If you are interested to try this game, i can send you a free test version of it. 
</p>

<p>After this, I started around 2 years ago with html, css and javascript to create my own website.
  In my freetime I take photos and post them on <a href="https://instagram.com/_backgroundphoto">Instagram</a>.
  My goal is to create a websites for small shops and also do a photoshooting by myself for them. 
  This is the reason why I started with programming for websites. 
  If you are interested in pictures as a background for your phone or computer, you can write me an E-Mail over my 
  <a href="./contact.html">Contact page</a>.
</p>

<p>For the future I want to improve my programming skills in javascript and other tools
  that I need to create interesting websites.
